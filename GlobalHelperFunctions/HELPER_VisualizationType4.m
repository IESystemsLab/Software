function [] = HELPER_VisualizationType4( ...
    xvals, xvalsLabel, ...
    yvals, yvalsLabel, ...  %This is expected to be a matrix containing data for multiple curves
	curveLabels, sharedTitle)
% This helper function is a bit of a hack ... rather than copy & paste several copies of the same
% visualization code, I extracted it here and generalized a bit.  However, I didn't really finish
% the generalization task (look at the function's arguments), nor think more broadly about different
% fundamental types of visualizations.
%
% The bigger picture:  In the demos we've written, we're observing that code to visualize results
% frequently comprises a large fraction of total lines of code - sometimes even a majority.  An
% effort (which we've barely started) would look for patterns in visualizations generated and most
% appreciated and helpful to users, and then write some generic functions to generate those
% visualizations.  The 'HELPER_VisualizationType<>' functions are a primitive first effort to
% separate the "Here's what we're trying to demonstrate" code from low-level figure manipulations.
